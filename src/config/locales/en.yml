      introContent: "Understanding the Schengen Area and the 90/180 Rule:
      The Schengen Area comprises 27 European countries, offering a seamless travel experience without internal borders. However, the 90/180 rule mandates that within any 180-day period, your stay in the Schengen Zone cannot exceed 90 days. This rule operates on a rolling basis, meaning each day counts towards your total stay."

      understanding90Content: "Keep in mind that the 90 in 180-day rule operates on a rolling basis. To illustrate, suppose you enter the Schengen Zone on January 1st and stay until March 30th, utilizing your full 90 days. If you re-enter on June 1st, you have another 90 days at your disposal. The key is to make sure that, on any given day within the area, you haven't exceeded 90 days in the last 180 days. It's a continuous calculation that you can understand to optimise your stay without violating the rule."
