      90_days_definition_blockquote: "“90 days in any 180-day period […]“. “The date of entry shall be considered as the first day of stay on the territory of the Member States and the date of exit shall be considered as the last day of stay on the territory of the Member States. Periods of stay authorized under a residence permit or a long-stay visa shall not be taken into account in the calculation of the duration of stay on the territory of the Member States.”\n"
      abolished_internal_borders: While having abolished their internal borders, Schengen States have a common external border agreement on the basis of Schengen rules. This makes it very convenient for tourists to travel between the countries included in Schengen area. However, it is important to understand the rules for what visa is required before entering the area (if any), and how long you can stay.
      additional_requirements:
        first_paragraph: Some countries have additional Visa waiver agreements with countries within the Schengen area allowing an additional 90 days in a 180 period stay; however, this will be included in the 90 days for other Schengen countries. These additional agreements are often little known by travellers!
        heading: Additional Visa Waiver agreements
        second_paragraph: Currently, the Schengen calculator does not take into account Additional Visa Waiver agreements. Please follow up on this with your own research.

      calculation_description:
        first_paragraph: This calculation is now only used for people from Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mauritius, and Seychelles where the old definition of the Schengen calculation continues to apply.
        second_paragraph: The old definition is different to a “rolling” 6 months, as it begins on the date of first entry, and then will reset 6 months after that date. Using this calculation can allow for longer stays that the new definition. For example, if you entered for one day at the start of January, and then re-entered 3 months later for 3 months to end of June, after that, the 6 months (from January), would reset allowing you to stay another 3 months, effectively allowing almost 6 months. However, you cannot stay more than 3 months continuous days, so you would have to exit and re-enter the Schengen Area.
        third_paragraph: The Schengen calculator takes this into account, so you can use the Schengen calculator to experiment with entry and exits dates to maximise your stay.
      calculator_description: The Schengen Calculator calculates the length of stay you are allowed to travel in the Schengen Area on a short term Schengen visa. You can use it to keep track, or forecast all of your visits inside the Schengen Area so you know how many days you have remaining before you have to leave.
