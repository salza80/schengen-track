/**
 * Critical CSS for Above-the-Fold Content
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * This CSS is inlined in the <head> of every page to eliminate render-blocking
 * CSS for the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element. By inlining critical styles,
 * the page can render immediately without waiting for external CSS files to download.
 * 
 * WHAT TO INCLUDE:
 * - Only styles needed for above-the-fold content (visible without scrolling)
 * - LCP element styles (.lead paragraph, headings)
 * - Essential layout utilities (margins, colors)
 * - Keep under 1-2KB to avoid bloating HTML
 * 
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * - Development: Inlined as readable CSS with comments via critical_css helper
 * - Production: Automatically minified (comments removed, whitespace collapsed)
 * - Location: app/views/layouts/application.html.erb uses <%= critical_css %>
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE IMPACT:
 * - Reduces LCP element render delay from ~3000ms to <100ms
 * - Improves Core Web Vitals and user experience
 * - Allows full CSS to load asynchronously without blocking render
 * 
 * MAINTENANCE:
 * - Only add styles that are absolutely critical for initial render
 * - Remove any style that isn't needed above-the-fold
 * - Test impact with Google PageSpeed Insights
