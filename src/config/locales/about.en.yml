      calculator_description: |
        The Schengen Calculator calculates the length of stay you are allowed to travel in the Schengen Area on a short term Schengen visa. You can use it to keep track, or forecast all of your visits inside the Schengen Area so you know how many days you have remaining before you have to leave.
      get_started: "Get Started Now"
      useful_for_planning: |
        It is especially useful for planning travel in Europe that will likely exceed 90 days. By traveling and spending time in and out of the Schengen Area strategically to lengthen your travels. If you are traveling between countries often it can be difficult to track how long you have spent in the Schengen Area, remember which countries are in the Schengen Area, and to calculate when you are able to return after spending time outside. Just enter your nationality, your previous travel and planned travel into the calculator, and it will work out the rest.

      what_is_schengen: "What is the Schengen Area"
      schengen_area_description: |
        The Schengen Area comprises 27 European countries without internal borders. Citizens, as well as many non-EU nationals, business people, and tourists, can freely circulate without facing border checks. Since 1985, it has expanded to include almost all EU states and a few associated non-EU countries.
      countries_in_schengen: |
        The countries in the Schengen area include are: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland.
      abolished_internal_borders: |
        While having abolished their internal borders, Schengen States have a common external border agreement on the basis of Schengen rules. This makes it very convenient for tourists to travel between the countries included in Schengen area. However, it is important to understand the rules for what visa is required before entering the area (if any), and how long you can stay.

      visa_requirements: "Visa Requirements"
      nationality_dependent_visa_requirement: |
        Depending on your nationality, you may need to apply for a Short Stay Schengen Visa before entering the Schengen area. The EU has a list of countries whose citizens must apply for a visa, and a list of countries that are exempt from this requirement. As at the 1st March 2015, the following countries are exempt from having to obtain a Schengen Visa prior to entry:
      exempt_countries_list: |
        Albania, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, El Salvador, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Macao, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Northern Marianas, Panama, Paraguay, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Serbia, Seychelles, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, United States, Uruguay and Venezuela.
      exempt_countries_conditions: |
        Please be aware that there are conditions on some of these countries. For example, Citizens of Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia are exempt from visa obligation only if the passport contains biometric data.
      non_eu_visa_requirement: |
        If you are from any other country (outside of the EU), you will need to apply for a Visa before you travel. The visa will specify the length of time it is valid, and the number of entries (of multi entry – unlimited) that are allowed. Please note that the “90 days in any 180 day period” still applies regardless of the Visa beginning and end dates. Use the Schengen calculator to enter your visa details, and to help calculate your allowed length of stay.
      length_of_stay_calculation: "Length of Stay Calculation"
      length_calculation_revision: "The calculation for calculating the allowed length of stay of third party nationals was revised and came into effect on %{date}. There are, however, a few which must still use the old calculation, these are Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mauritius, and Seychelles. This Schengen calculator uses the old or new calculation depending on your nationality and date of travel, so nationals of these countries may still use the calculator."

      90_days_definition_blockquote: |
        “90 days in any 180-day period […]“. “The date of entry shall be considered as the first day of stay on the territory of the Member States and the date of exit shall be considered as the last day of stay on the territory of the Member States. Periods of stay authorized under a residence permit or a long-stay visa shall not be taken into account in the calculation of the duration of stay on the territory of the Member States.”

      calculation_description:
        first_paragraph: "This calculation is now only used for people from Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mauritius, and Seychelles where the old definition of the Schengen calculation continues to apply."
        second_paragraph: "The old definition is different to a “rolling” 6 months, as it begins on the date of first entry, and then will reset 6 months after that date. Using this calculation can allow for longer stays that the new definition. For example, if you entered for one day at the start of January, and then re-entered 3 months later for 3 months to end of June, after that, the 6 months (from January), would reset allowing you to stay another 3 months, effectively allowing almost 6 months. However, you cannot stay more than 3 months continuous days, so you would have to exit and re-enter the Schengen Area."
        third_paragraph: "The Schengen calculator takes this into account, so you can use the Schengen calculator to experiment with entry and exits dates to maximise your stay."

        heading: "Additional Visa Waiver agreements"
        first_paragraph: "Some countries have additional Visa waiver agreements with countries within the Schengen area allowing an additional 90 days in a 180 period stay; however, this will be included in the 90 days for other Schengen countries. These additional agreements are often little known by travellers!"
