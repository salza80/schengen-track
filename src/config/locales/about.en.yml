      90_days_definition_blockquote: "“90 days in any 180-day period […]“. “The date of entry shall be considered as the first day of stay on the territory of the Member States and the date of exit shall be considered as the last day of stay on the territory of the Member States. Periods of stay authorized under a residence permit or a long-stay visa shall not be taken into account in the calculation of the duration of stay on the territory of the Member States.”\n"
      abolished_internal_borders: While having abolished their internal borders, Schengen States have a common external border agreement on the basis of Schengen rules. This makes it very convenient for tourists to travel between the countries included in Schengen area. However, it is important to understand the rules for what visa is required before entering the area (if any), and how long you can stay.
      additional_requirements:
        first_paragraph: Some countries have additional Visa waiver agreements with countries within the Schengen area allowing an additional 90 days in a 180 period stay; however, this will be included in the 90 days for other Schengen countries. These additional agreements are often little known by travellers!
        heading: Additional Visa Waiver agreements
        second_paragraph: Currently, the Schengen calculator does not take into account Additional Visa Waiver agreements. Please follow up on this with your own research.

      calculation_description:
        paragraph: All travelers use the standard Schengen calculation to determine their allowed length of stay. This is defined as "90 days in any 180-day period". The Schengen calculator takes this into account, so you can use it to experiment with entry and exit dates to maximize your stay.
      calculator_description: The Schengen Calculator calculates the length of stay you are allowed to travel in the Schengen Area on a short term Schengen visa. You can use it to keep track, or forecast all of your visits inside the Schengen Area so you know how many days you have remaining before you have to leave.

      etias_additional_info: ETIAS does not change the 90/180-day rule. You will still need to comply with the standard Schengen calculation for your length of stay, but you will need the ETIAS authorization before you can enter.
      etias_coming_soon: ETIAS will start operations in the last quarter of 2026. No action is required from travellers at this point. The European Union will inform about the specific date for the start of ETIAS several months prior to its launch.
      etias_description: ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System) is a pre-travel authorization system for visa-exempt travelers entering the Schengen Area. It is similar to the US ESTA or Canadian eTA.

      faq:
        q1:
          answer: The 90/180 day rule means you can stay in the Schengen Area for up to 90 days within any 180-day period without a visa (if you're from a visa-exempt country). The 180-day period is a rolling window that looks back from your current date.
          question: What is the Schengen 90/180 day rule?
        q10:
          answer: Yes, the Schengen Calculator is completely free to use. You can calculate your stays, add unlimited travel records, and even register for a free account to save your data across devices. No credit card required, no hidden fees.
          question: Is the Schengen Calculator free to use?
        q2:
          answer: The 180-day period is calculated backwards from your current or planned exit date. For each day you want to stay, the calculator checks how many days you've already spent in the Schengen Area during the previous 180 days. You cannot exceed 90 days in total within this rolling period.
          question: How is the 180-day period calculated?
        q3:
          answer: No, the 90/180 rule is a rolling calculation. Leaving and re-entering does not reset your 90-day allowance. You must wait until days from your previous visits fall outside the 180-day window. The Schengen Calculator helps you track exactly when you can return.
          question: Can I reset my 90 days by leaving the Schengen Area?
        q4:
          answer: No, UK citizens do not need a visa for short stays (up to 90 days in any 180-day period) in the Schengen Area. However, from Q4 2026, UK citizens will need an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System) approval before traveling.
          question: Do UK citizens need a visa to visit the Schengen Area after Brexit?
        q5:
          answer: Overstaying can result in serious consequences including fines, deportation, entry bans (typically 1-5 years), and difficulties obtaining future visas or travel authorizations. Always ensure you comply with the 90/180 day rule and leave before exceeding your allowed stay.
          question: What happens if I overstay my 90 days in the Schengen Area?
        q6:
          answer: As of 2025, there are 29 Schengen countries including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Bulgaria and Romania joined fully on March 31, 2024.
          question: Which countries are in the Schengen Area in 2025?
        q7:
          answer: Yes, any day you are physically present in the Schengen Area counts toward your 90-day limit, including transit days and days when you're simply passing through airports or train stations. The day of entry and day of exit both count as full days.
          question: Do days in transit count toward my 90-day limit?
        q8:
          answer: ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorization System) is a pre-travel authorization required for visa-exempt travelers starting Q4 2026. Citizens from countries like the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and others who currently don't need a visa will need ETIAS approval. It's similar to the US ESTA and costs approximately €7, valid for 3 years.
          question: What is ETIAS and who needs it?
        q9:
          answer: Yes! The calculator supports both visa-exempt travelers and those with short-stay Schengen visas. Simply enter your visa details (start date, end date, number of entries) and your travel record. The calculator will track both your 90/180 day limit and your visa-specific restrictions.
          question: Can I use the Schengen Calculator if I have a Schengen visa?
